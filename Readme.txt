We have this working for the most part, however for some reason
when you start the program and press F6 intially, it thinks
all the boxes are colliding. It isn't until you start moving
some of them that you see that the collision detection works
when they intersect. We plan on talking to Alberto about this
however should you get to this before we can talk to Alberto
any feedback on the issue would be greatly appreciated.

Thanks
